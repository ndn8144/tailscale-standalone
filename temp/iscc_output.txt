Warning: Architecture identifier "x64" is deprecated. Substituting "x64os", but note that "x64compatible" is preferred in most cases. See the "Architecture Identifiers" topic in help file for more information.
Warning: There are [UninstallRun] section entries without a RunOnceId parameter. By assigning a string to RunOnceId, you can ensure that a particular [UninstallRun] entry will only be executed once during uninstallation. See the "[UninstallRun]" topic in help file for more information.
Warning: The [Setup] section directive "PrivilegesRequired" is set to "admin" but per-user areas (userappdata) are used by the script. Regardless of the version of Windows, if the installation is running in administrative install mode then you should be careful about making any per-user area changes: such changes may not achieve what you are intending. See the "UsedUserAreasWarning" topic in help file for more information.
Warning: Line 143, Column 10: [Hint] Support function "IsAdminLoggedOn" has been renamed. Use "IsAdmin" instead or consider using "IsAdminInstallMode".
